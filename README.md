Project Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning application that classifies iris flowers into different species based on their physical characteristics. This project uses the famous Iris dataset, which is widely used for learning and practicing classification algorithms in data science.
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify the species of an iris flower using measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

```Problem Statement
Given the measurements of an iris flower:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

Predict the species of the flower, which can be:
Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolor
Iris Virginica

Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook
```
